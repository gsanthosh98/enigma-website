## how come team-enigma

One of the members had a project, which needed more members, and so when he asked the hostellers of one single room, all of them joined in. Thus formed team-enigma.

## the name team-enigma

This is a team of four, so the name has the `team` part in it. And `enigma` stands for the infamous enigma machine that was cracked by the allied forces in world-war-2. No brainstorming session was done to come up with the name. It just happened.
